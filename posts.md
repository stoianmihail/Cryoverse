Hi!

We all know how important temperature stability is.
In our cases, we preferred a stability of < 1 mK for temperatures in the range 4.5 and ~8K.
 
Thus we ordered the custom LT3-B cryostat from ARS where they use the special matrix heat exchanger technology and a coaxial shield flow transfer line to minimize temperature fluctuations. But unfortunately so far we could only achieve a temperature stability of ~1mK only below 5K. We are currently still in the process of figuring out why it is the case.

Any ideas for improving the stability for this kind of cryostats?

Thanks!

So great to be here!

Do you have any helpful references, which could help improve my experiments in this case?

I have a new cryostat from https://kiutra.com/. However, I've just found that manipulating the sample is a bit cumbersome.
Do you have any suggestions on that?

Best,
F

Dear all,

Have you heard about the matrix heat exchanger technology and the coaxial shield flow transfer line of ARS (what they call "Helitran")?

You can read about it here: https://www.arscryo.com/helitran-advanced-features

I am interested in what you think about it.

Best,
Peter.

Hi, folks!

This forum is great!
I wanted to suggest a new feature: maybe we can all see which type of cryostats we all use.
This would create a big picture of what kind of cryostats are most-used nowadays.

A ranking would be a great tool for this.

My group leader asked me to buy a new one.

However, we've already a very old cryostat, which does have really powerful magnets.
For this reason, we wanted to buy a cryostat which would be compatible to our magnets.

Any hints on that? Thanks!
